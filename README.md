# Calculator-in-react

[Live Website](https://calc-noteval.netlify.app/)



##CalculatorAPP
I had created calculator before when i was starting to learn JS, but at that time i used the eval() method.
But for this I had to look for a way to create it from scratch, even though I'm sure there is a library out there for react that can do this.
So I looked online and found a way to make it with class constructor, so I learned from that and tried doing it in react (the source was in vanilla JS), and even 
though I didn't change much from what i learned I tried my best to use React states to make it easy to write.
